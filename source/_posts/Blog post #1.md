	When one thinks about learning a language, dialects such as Spanish, French, German,  and many other widely-spoken idioms come to mind first. Rarely does a person say they are tri-lingual, and mean they are fluent in English, CSS, and Ruby. Since computer languages are often not taught at schools, I think it requires people to have a growth mindset and be open for learning new things. Picking up a computer language demands the student to be mentally prepared and eager for the challenge, as was being discussed in the “Fixed vs Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives” article. For those with a fixed mindset, “imperfections are shameful,” yet those with the growth mindset are willing to go through trial and error periods, make mistakes, and learn from their failures until they are comfortable with the material (Fixed).  There is a certain level of comfort when learning certain new idioms, due to their similarity, like Spanish and Portuguese are extremely similar, so knowing one helps learn the other quickly. However, programming languages differ in that it utilizes keyboard character not typically used. The values assigned to thee keys are not always as logical as in spoken languages. Many people with a fixed mindset would shy away from the challenge of learning a computer language because it is so different, they would be afraid to try new things since they are not already skilled or knowledgable in the subject (Fixed). I, as well as everyone reading this blog have a growth mindset, and are actively working to increase intelligence (Allison). 
	Thinking like a programmer requires the patience to analyze methods piece by piece, allowing time to make mistakes (How). Learning to program will be a long and tedious task, but stay focused and motivated for optimal results. Although the learning process can be mundane, once one starts to get into the “zen of coding,” the experience becomes enjoyable (How). In such a digital age, programming and computer languages are becoming more vital. Having the ability to be involved with and understand the Internet and all it offers will open so many more opportunities. Keep this optimistic, growth mindset when putting in the long hours mastering these new skills. Use the Internet to your advantage, reaching out for advice and instruction online from others who have gone through the same learning process that you are encountering (How).
